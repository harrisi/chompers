Learning how to implement a language.

This is a learning/test repo for implementing a language. The goal is to
understand better how to take a simple language and compile it to a format that
will run on my virtual machine (development happening at the same time over at
[harrisi/simple-python-night](https://github.com/harrisi/simple-python-night)).

I am using a variety of resources for learning, but so far the most excellent
resource I'm using is the [`PL Tutorial`](http://lisperator.net/pltut/) by
[Mihai Bazon](http://lisperator.net/). It certainly doesn't seem to be aimed at
complete beginners, but if you can understand JavaScript, the code will mostly
speak for itself when the author doesn't.
